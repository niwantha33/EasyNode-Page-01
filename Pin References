#Operating voltage -----5V
#Current : 75mA
#Power feed options : 3.3V and 5V 

#Input and Output pins 

##pin(13) -------- I/O (With Lowpass filter) 
##pin(12) -------- I/O (With Lowpass filter) 
##pin(14) -------- I/O (With Lowpass filter) 
##pin(16) -------- I/O (With Lowpass filter) 

#Debug Pin 

##DBG------------------ pin :2 
Can define as "Serial1" (Serial+"1") for program debug purpose 
and also you can use inbuilt SMD LED 0603 with 270 Ohm SMD 0805 package resistor in order to 
use as a debug solution

#Analog input with Analog Ground 
A0---------------------- Directly you can connect any analog sensors which has maximum voltage "5V"
do not exceed more than 5V 
* if not you can use this pin for internal voltage measures 

#DWN Jumper pin 

In order to download firmware to the EasyNode you have to bridge DWN jumper pins together

#Wakeup Mode

You can use this jumper to set restart from deep-sleep 
this method will help to save battery and minimise unnecessary connections to router

#Additional 5V and 3.3V pins 

Directly you can use these pins to power external sensors 

# You can use 5V or 3.3V to power the EasyNode
